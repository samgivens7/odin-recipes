        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This tangy, creamy Buffalo chicken dip tastes just like Buffalo 
            chicken wings! Perfect for parties and game day, this chicken 
            dip is best served hot with crackers and celery sticks.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (10 ounce) cans chunk chicken, drained</li>
            <li>¾ cup pepper sauce (such as Frank's Red Hot®)</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup Ranch dressing</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 bunch celery, cleaned and cut into 4 inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) box chicken-flavored crackers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat chicken and hot sauce in a skillet over medium heat 
                until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in cream cheese 
                and ranch dressing. Cook and stir until well blended and 
                warm, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix in 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, and transfer the mixture 
                to a slow cooker. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over top.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook on Low until dip is hot and bubbly, about 
                35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve with celery sticks and crackers.</li>
        </ol>
